## Data

See my [notebook](http://timothykylethomas.me/weather_tables.html) for details and code for how I put together the data underlying the app. Data is mostly scraped from Wikipedia. 

The comfort tab is a work in progress. I am still trying to figure out a good index for ideal weather. It currently supposes that a high of 72 and low of 60 with as little of clouds, rain, and snow is ideal. 

## Packages

I would like to think the makers of the following packages:

* `tidyverse`: used for manipulating and plotting data
* `shiny`: used to construct the online application
* `plotly`: used for the interactive cluster plot
* `ggthemes`: used for easy solarized themes
* `ggTimeSeries`: used for the comfort plot
* `viridis`: used for the magma gradient

## Color Schemes

Most colors are from Ethan Schoonover's [solarized color scheme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
